This is a piet interpreter written in Rust.

Piet is a programming language which aims to treat images similar to those of the artist **Piet Mondrian** as executables.
Read more about how images are executed [at the Piet homepage](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html).

## State of this crate

This is my current "I learn some Rust" project.
I will expand it every time I have some minutes to work on it, but don't expect it to be complete anytime soon.
This project is likely to become my bikeshedding target to learn some Rust concepts and won't be able to execute actual piet images soon.

However, feel free to watch this space and give me feedback on the code if you feel like it. ðŸŒ»
