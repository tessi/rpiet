This is a piet interpreter written in Rust.

Piet is a programming language which aims to treat images similar to those of the artist **Piet Mondrian** as executables.
Read more about how images are executed [at the Piet homepage](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html).

## State of this crate

It is possible to run some Piet programs in it (I verified a couple of hello world images from the Piet homepage), please report any bugs you find - the specification is somewhat loose :)

"Sliding" (wording of the spec, not mine) through white codels may be buggy when reaching black/edge codels.

The implementation is sometimes hacky - partly because I'm starting with Rust and am not yet writing ideomatic Rust everywhere, partly because I wanted things to work first and make them beautiful later.
